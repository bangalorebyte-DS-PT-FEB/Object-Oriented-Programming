**Homework Challanges**

1) Create a class named Bank Account that has a) an initial balance of 0 b)the ability to Deposit c) the ability to Withdraw and d) enforces a minimum balance of a 100. 

2) Python does not have in-built Stack or Queue objects. Create 2 classes called Stack and Queue respectively that have the behaviour that we discussed in class. 

3)  Create a user database (login, password, and last login timestamp) class that manages a system requiring users to log in before access to resources is allowed. This database class manages its users, loading any previously saved user information on instantiation and providing accessor functions to add or update database information. If updated, the database will save the new information to disk as part of its deallocation (see __del__()).
